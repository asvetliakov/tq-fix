// Instrumentation written into Engine.dll's .text.
//
// Every instrument before this one was a vtable slot or mod-side code. This
// one patches the game's own instruction stream on paths that run thousands of
// times a second, so the whole module is built around not installing:
//
// - nothing installs unless the performance probe is on *and* [debug]
//   engine_trace is not 0, so the shipping configuration is byte-identical to
//   a build without this file;
// - every target is resolved by decorated export name and then asserted
//   against the RVA the audit recorded, so a different Engine.dll resolves to
//   a different address and installs nothing;
// - every site verifies 16-24 bytes before it writes 4-7, because the four
//   busiest targets share the same six-byte prologue;
// - each hook installs independently and one failure leaves the others alone;
// - shutdown() restores every site in reverse, and only where the bytes are
//   still the ones we wrote.
//
// What it answers is in probe.h, below CounterEngineLevelLoad.

// Reads [debug] engine_trace. 0 disables the module outright; 1 (the default)
// installs everything; any larger value is a mask, so a run that misbehaves
// can be bisected from the INI rather than from a rebuild:
//   2  region and resource loads      4  archive reads and block inflates
//   8  the loader fence wait         16  the region lock on the render path
//  32  the resource-manager sweeps   64  Region::WaitForLoadingToFinish
// 128  Engine::Update and Engine::Render, bracketed whole
// 256  GameEngine::Update -- the one hook that is in Game.dll
// 512  TQ.exe's main loop, through its import table, patching nothing:
//      its sleep, its message pump, its waits, Engine::PresentSurface
//      and the collision fixup
